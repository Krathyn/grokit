grokIt is a project created to make ngrok as easy to use as humanly possible.
It started as a discussion to get a D&D tool Encounter+ (which I highly recomend) easily available to reach via internet and not just for those technically inclinded.
It is a wrapper of a wrapper of ngrok and uses pyngrok and PyQt5 to create a GUI it also downloads it's own copy of ngrok via pyngrok.
If you're technically inclinded, having python3, pyngrok and PyQt5 installed will allow you to use it.
If you're not technically inclinded, I'm trying to make an easily distributable version. So far I've gotten it mostly to work. Your mileage may vary.
I'm more then open to any additions or fixes that people want to try.
